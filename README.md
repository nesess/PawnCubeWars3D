# Pawn Cube Wars 3D

A casual game made as a group for UdoNextGen Internship in 2021 summer.

  When we first start to make this game, our main goal was to make a hyper-casual game, but as we progressed through the production phase, we found ourselves making more of a puzzle game. 

  Our main goal in this game is to eliminate all enemy pawns. For this, our own pawns must be outnumbered to enemy. As you can see in the gameplay video, we can increase the number of our pawns by using the cube rotation mechanic in our game to reach places we cannot reach by normal roads. In this way, we become outnumbered to enemy pawns.
